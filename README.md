## Introduction

The `HiddenEye: Reborn` tool is a project aimed at exploiting human errors. As my second attempt at creating a comprehensive tool for this purpose, it presently has numerous phishing features. We intend to add more functionalities soon. Keep up with our progress by checking out our [roadmap] (*insert link of roadmap here*) or the Projects Tab on our GitHub page. 

## Disclaimer

**Please Note**: The utilization of `HiddenEye: Reborn` and its resources lies entirely with the end user. The developers of this tool assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage resulting from it. Ensure you have explicit written permission from the intended party before conducting any testing, as some actions may be illegal. 

## Installation

You can easily install `HE: RE` on PyPI using pip: 
```sh
pip install hiddeneye-reborn
```
Just like that, `HE: RE` is ready for use as a terminal command and can also be added as a package to your projects.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is the original `HiddenEye` no longer maintained?**  
A: The original `HiddenEye` was phased out due to bad practices and low quality in the code.  

**Q: I noticed the original `HiddenEye` had more tunneling options. Why aren't most of them available anymore?**  
A: As technology evolves, providers adapt. Some of these options are now obsolete or have changed the way they work. But don't worry, we'll always find new ones as they become available. 

**Q: Are there any example uses for this tool?**  
A: The usage entirely depends on the user. We disclaim liability for any actions taken by users. However, numerous legal uses for this tool include testing employees or colleagues to educate them about potential vulnerabilities, which social engineers could exploit. 

**Q: Why are there slow updates from the developers?**   
A: As an open-source software, the community does not generate revenue. Our developers need to balance their time between financial stability and updating `HE: RE`. If you want to see the software develop further, consider supporting the developers!
