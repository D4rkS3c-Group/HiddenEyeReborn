## Introduction

The `HiddenEye: Reborn` tool is a project aimed at exploiting human error. As my second attempt at creating a comprehensive tool for this purpose, it presently has numerous phishing features. We intend to add more functionality soon. Keep up with our progress by checking out our [roadmap] (*insert link of roadmap here*) and the Projects Tab on our GitHub page. 

## Disclaimer

**Please Note**: The utilization of `HiddenEye: Reborn` and its resources lies entirely with the end user. The developers of this tool assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage resulting from it. Ensure you have explicit written permission from the intended party before conducting any testing, as some actions may be illegal otherwise. 

## Installation

You can easily install `HE:RE` on PyPI using pip: 
```bash
pip install hiddeneye-reborn
```
Just like that, `HE:RE` is ready for use as a terminal command and can also be added as a package to your projects.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is the original `HiddenEye` no longer maintained?**  
A: The original `HiddenEye` was phased out due to bad practices and low quality of the code. Updating and refactoring it could take an enormous amount of time.

**Q: I've noticed the original `HiddenEye` had more tunneling options. Why aren't most of them available anymore?**  
A: As technology evolves, providers adapt. Some of these options are now obsolete or have changed the way they work. But don't worry, we'll always find new ones as they become available. If there are tunneling options we are not aware of - feel free to make an Issue with a Feature Request to let up know about it.

**Q: Are there any example uses for this tool?**  
A: Numerous legal uses for this tool include teaching employees or colleagues about the potential vulnerabilities, which social engineers could exploit. However, the usage of this tool entirely depends on the user, and we disclaim liability for any actions taken. 

**Q: Why are updates so slow?**   
A: The community of the HiddenEye does not generate any revenue as it's entirely FOSS. Our developers need to balance their time between financial stability and updating `HE:RE`. If you want to see the software develop faster, consider supporting the developers!
